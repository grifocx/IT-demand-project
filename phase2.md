# Phase 2: Reporting and Analytics Feature

This document outlines the plan for implementing the reporting and analytics feature in DemandIT.

## 1. Create the Reporting Page

-   **Task:** Create a new page component at `src/app/reporting/page.tsx`.
-   **Details:** This page will serve as the main dashboard for all reports and analytics.
-   **Sub-tasks:**
    -   Create the basic page structure with a title and layout.
    -   Add a link to the reporting page in the main navigation (`src/components/main-nav.tsx`).

## 2. Develop API Endpoints for Reporting Data

-   **Task:** Create new API routes in `src/app/api/reporting/` to fetch the data needed for the reports.
-   **Details:** These endpoints will provide the data for the charts and graphs on the reporting page.
-   **Sub-tasks:**
    -   Create an endpoint for demand analytics (e.g., demands by category, priority, status over time).
    -   Create an endpoint for project analytics (e.g., project budget vs. spent, project timelines, burndown charts).
    -   Create an endpoint for resource analytics (e.g., resource allocation, utilization, capacity).

## 3. Implement Data Visualizations

-   **Task:** Use the existing `recharts` library to create various charts and graphs for the reporting page.
-   **Details:** The charts will provide a visual representation of the data.
-   **Sub-tasks:**
    -   Implement bar charts for categorical data (e.g., demands by status).
    -   Implement line charts for time-series data (e.g., burndown charts).
    -   Implement pie charts for proportional data (e.g., resource allocation by project).

## 4. Add Filtering and Exporting Capabilities

-   **Task:** Add controls to the reporting page to filter the data and export it.
-   **Details:** This will allow users to customize the reports to their needs.
-   **Sub-tasks:**
    -   Add filters for date range, project, user, etc.
    -   Implement functionality to export the report data to CSV or PDF.

## 5. Write Tests for the New Functionality

-   **Task:** Add tests for the new reporting and analytics feature.
-   **Details:** This will ensure the feature is working correctly and prevent regressions.
-   **Sub-tasks:**
    -   Add unit tests for the new API endpoints.
    -   Add integration tests for the reporting page.
